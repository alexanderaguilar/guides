##Welcome to *El Núcleo Digital* Styleguides

The point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding so people can concentrate on what you’re saying rather than on how you’re saying it. We present global style rules here so people know the vocabulary, but local style is also important. If code you add to a file looks drastically different from the existing code around it, it throws readers out of their rhythm when they go to read it. Avoid this.

Before reading this, you should have a general understanding for specificity, javascript, jQuery, HTML and CSS.

If you're visiting from the internet, feel free to learn from this styles. This is a guide we use for our own apps internally at **El Núcleo Digital** inspired by other styleguides. We encourage you to set up one that works for your own team.

##Linters:

A lint tool performs static analysis of source code and flags patterns that might be errors or otherwise cause problems for the developer.

##Tools:

- [JS Hint](http://www.jshint.com/): Is a tool to detect errors and potential problems in JavaScript code and can be used to enforce coding coventions.
- [CSS Lint](http://csslint.net/): This tool points out problems with your CSS code. It does basic syntax checking as well as applying a set of rules to the code that look for problematic patterns or signs of inefficiency.
- [Styleneat](http://styleneat.com/): It organizes and standardizes your CSS - selectors, sub-selectors and properties - in a structure that makes it easier to define page areas and see how they relate to each other.
- [jsBeutifier](http://jsbeautifier.org/): This little beautifier will reformat and reindent bookmarklets, ugly JavaScript.
- [CSS Compressor](http://www.cssdrive.com/index.php/main/csscompressor/): Use this utility to compress your CSS to increase loading speed and save on bandwidth as well.
- [Sprite Cow](http://www.spritecow.com/): This site helps you get the background-position, width and height of sprites within a spritesheet as a nice bit of copyable css.
