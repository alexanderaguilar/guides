##Introduction

This document defines formatting and style rules for CSS. It aims at improving collaboration, code quality, and enabling supporting infrastructure. It applies to raw, working files that use CSS. Tools are free to obfuscate, minify, and compile as long as the general code quality is maintained.

> Please also review our [**HTML Style Guide**](../html/README.md) along with this one.

##General Style Rules

###Protocol

Omit the protocol from embedded resources.

Omit the protocol portion (http:, https:) from URLs pointing to images and other media files, style sheets, and scripts unless the respective files are not available over both protocols.

Omitting the protocol—which makes the URL relative—prevents mixed content issues and results in minor file size savings.

```css
/* Not recommended */
.example {
	background: url(http://www.google.com/images/example);
}

/* Recommended */
.example {
  	background: url(//www.google.com/images/example);
}
```

##CSS Style Rules

###CSS validity

Use valid CSS where possible.

Unless dealing with CSS validator bugs or requiring proprietary syntax, use valid CSS code.

Use tools such as the [W3C CSS validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to test.

Using valid CSS is a measurable baseline quality attribute that allows to spot CSS code that may not have any effect and can be removed, and that ensures proper CSS usage.

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**

###Using ID selectors
To be clear, using ID attributes in your HTML can be a good thing and in some cases, absolutely necessary. For example, they provide efficient hooks for JavaScript. For CSS, however, ID selectors aren’t necessary as the performance difference between ID and class selectors is nearly non-existent and can make styling more complicated due to increasing specificity.

```css
/* Not recommended */
#header{ color: red; }

/* Recommended */
.header{ color: red; }
```

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**

###ID and class naming

Use meaningful or generic ID and class names.

Instead of presentational or cryptic names, always use ID and class names that reflect the purpose of the element in question, or that are otherwise generic.

Names that are specific and reflect the purpose of the element should be preferred as these are most understandable and the least likely to change.

Generic names are simply a fallback for elements that have no particular or no meaning different from their siblings. They are typically needed as “helpers.”

Using functional or generic names reduces the probability of unnecessary document or template changes.

```css
/* Not recommended: meaningless */
.yee-1901 {}

/* Not recommended: presentational */
.button-green {}
.clear {}

/* Recommended: specific */
.gallery {}
.login {}
.video {}

/* Recommended: generic */
.aux {}
.alt {}
```

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**

###ID and class name style

Use ID and class names that are as short as possible but as long as necessary.

Try to convey what an ID or class is about while being as brief as possible.

Using ID and class names this way contributes to acceptable levels of understandability and code efficiency.

```css
/* Not recommended */
#navigation {}
.atr {}

/* Recommended */
.nav {}
.author {}
```

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**

###Type selectors

Avoid qualifying ID and class names with type selectors.

Unless necessary (for example with helper classes), do not use element names in conjunction with IDs or classes.

Avoiding unnecessary ancestor selectors is useful for performance reasons.

```css
/* Not recommended */
ul#example {}
div.error {}

/* Recommended */
.example {}
.error {}
```

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**

###Shorthand properties

Use shorthand properties where possible.

CSS offers a variety of shorthand properties (like font) that should be used whenever possible, even in cases where only one value is explicitly set.

Using shorthand properties is useful for code efficiency and understandability.

```css
/* Not recommended */
border-top-style: none;
font-family: palatino, georgia, serif;
font-size: 100%;
line-height: 1.6;
padding-bottom: 2em;
padding-left: 1em;
padding-right: 1em;
padding-top: 0;

/* Recommended */
border-top: 0;
font: 100%/1.6 palatino, georgia, serif;
padding: 0 1em 2em;
```

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**

###0 and units

Omit unit specification after “0” values.

Do not use units after 0 values unless they are required.

```css
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
```

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**

###Leading 0s

Omit leading “0”s in values.

Do not use put 0s in front of values or lengths between -1 and 1.

```css
font-size: .8em;
```

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**

###Hexadecimal notation

Use 3 character hexadecimal notation where possible.

For color values that permit it, 3 character hexadecimal notation is shorter and more succinct.

```css
/* Not recommended */
color: #eebbcc;

/* Recommended */
color: #ebc;
```

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**

###Prefixes

Prefix selectors with an application-specific prefix (optional).

In large projects as well as for code that gets embedded in other projects or on external sites use prefixes (as namespaces) for ID and class names. Use short, unique identifiers followed by a dash.

Using namespaces helps preventing naming conflicts and can make maintenance easier, for example in search and replace operations.

```css
.adw-help {} /* AdWords */
#maia-note {} /* Maia */
```

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**

###ID and class name delimiters

Separate words in ID and class names by a hyphen.

Do not concatenate words and abbreviations in selectors by any characters (including none at all) other than hyphens, in order to improve understanding and scannability.

```css
/* Not recommended: does not separate the words “demo” and “image” */
.demoimage {}

/* Not recommended: uses underscore instead of hyphen */
.error_status {}

/* Recommended */
.video-id {}
.ads-sample {}
```

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**

###Hacks

Avoid user agent detection as well as CSS “hacks”—try a different approach first.

It’s tempting to address styling differences over user agent detection or special CSS filters, workarounds, and hacks. Both approaches should be considered last resort in order to achieve and maintain an efficient and manageable code base. Put another way, giving detection and hacks a free pass will hurt projects in the long run as projects tend to take the way of least resistance. That is, allowing and making it easy to use detection and hacks means using detection and hacks more frequently—and more frequently is too frequently.

##CSS Formatting Rules

###Declaration order

Alphabetize declarations.

Put declarations in alphabetical order in order to achieve consistent code in a way that is easy to remember and maintain.

Ignore vendor-specific prefixes for sorting purposes. However, multiple vendor-specific prefixes for a certain CSS property should be kept sorted (e.g. -moz prefix comes before -webkit).

```css
background: fuchsia;
border: 1px solid;
-moz-border-radius: 4px;
-webkit-border-radius: 4px;
border-radius: 4px;
color: black;
text-align: center;
text-indent: 2em;
```

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**

###Block content indentation

Indent all block content.

Indent all block content, that is rules within rules as well as declarations, so to reflect hierarchy and improve understanding.

```css
@media screen, projection {

  html {
    background: #fff;
    color: #444;
  }

}
```

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**

###Declaration stops

Use a semicolon after every declaration.

End every declaration with a semicolon for consistency and extensibility reasons.

```css
/* Not recommended */
.test {
  display: block;
  height: 100px
}

/* Recommended */
.test {
  display: block;
  height: 100px;
}
```

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**

###Property name stops

Use a space after a property name’s colon.

Always use a single space between property and value (but no space between property and colon) for consistency reasons.

```css
/* Not recommended */
h3 {
  font-weight:bold;
}

/* Recommended */
h3 {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**

###Selector and declaration separation

Separate selectors and declarations by new lines.

Always start a new line for each selector and declaration.

```css
/* Not recommended */
a:focus, a:active {
  position: relative; top: 1px;
}

/* Recommended */
h1,
h2,
h3 {
  font-weight: normal;
  line-height: 1.2;
}
```

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**

###Rule separation

Separate rules by new lines.

Always put a line between rules.

```css
html {
  background: #fff;
}

body {
  margin: auto;
  width: 50%;
}
```

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**

###CSS quotation marks

Use single quotation marks for attribute selectors and property values where necessary.

When quoting attribute selectors and property values, use single ('') rather than double ("") quotation marks. Do not use quotation marks in URI values (url()).

```css
/* Not recommended */
@import url("//www.google.com/css/maia.css");

html {
  font-family: "open sans", arial, sans-serif;
}

/* Recommended */
@import url(//www.google.com/css/maia.css);

html {
  font-family: 'open sans', arial, sans-serif;
}
```

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**

##CSS Meta Rules

###Section comments

Group sections by a section comment (optional).

If possible, group style sheet sections together by using comments. Separate sections with new lines.

```css
/* Header */

.adw-header {}

/* Footer */

.adw-footer {}

/* Gallery */

.adw-gallery {}
```
