##Introduction

This document defines general purpose formatting and style rules. It aims at improving collaboration, code quality, and enabling supporting infrastructure. It applies to raw, working files. Tools are free to obfuscate, minify, and compile as long as the general code quality is maintained.

Every file must apply this rules except when overriden by:
- Filetype specific guides
- Specific framework or tool style/formatting guides
- Specific project rules (specially relevant for legacy projects)

> **Note:** To keep homogeneity accross the project's files, some rules can be overriden based on the main language or framework used - e.g. If a PHP framework's guide suggests using tabs instead of spaces, tabs should be used not only on the PHP files but on stylesheets and scripts as well.

Tune up your IDE or text editor to follow this rules.

##General Formatting Rules

- Use UTF-8 without BOM
- Use Unix line endings - LF, **not** CR (MacOS) or LF+CR (Windows)
- Use 4 white spaces identation

  ```javascript
  // Way to go:
  if (indent === 4) {
  ····var imHappy = true;
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  // Avoid this:
  ··var twoSpaces;
  ↦   var orTabs;
  ```

- Remove trailing whitespaces

  ```html
  <!-- Bad, bad, bad -->
  <div class="error">Trailing white spaces ahead</div>····
  ```

- Use a **single** blank line to separate code blocks

  ```javascript
  // This is cool:
  var me = 'Hello';
  ····
  me = me + ' world!';
  me = me + ' Wazzup?!';
  ····
  var world = 'I am fine';
  ```

  ```javascript
  // This is not:
  var me = 'Hello';
  ····
  ····
  ····
  var world = 'Sorry, too many white lines, I cannot hear you';
  ```

- Leave a single blank line at the end of the file

  ```javascript
  // Don't:
  endOfFile = true;
  ····
  ····
  ····
  ```

  ```javascript
  // Don't:
  endOfFile = true; // That's it, no blank lines
  ```

  ```javascript
  // Do:
  endOfFile = true;
  ····
  ```

##General Style Guides

- Eligable names (e.g. variables, functions, identifiers, attributes):
  - Must be wrtitten in **English**
  - Should be meaningful
  - Should be as short as possible but as long as necessary
  - Should be abbreviated only if it's a well known convention (e.g. ```nav``` instead of ```navigation```)
  - Should be consistent accross the project, even accross different filetypes

    ```html
    <!-- This is awful in so many ways (track, song, mp3 and audio to refer
         the same thing) -->

    ····

    <style>
        .track {
            ····
        }
    </style>

    ····

    <script>
        ····
        var song = $('.mp3');
        ····
    </script>

    ····

    <a href="····" class="mp3 track">
        <?php echo $audio->getFile(); ?>
    </a>

    ····
    ```

    ```html
    <!-- This is much nicer (track everywhere) -->

    ····

    <style>
        .track {
            ····
        }
    </style>

    ····

    <script>
        ····
        var track = $('.track');
        ····
    </script>

    ····

    <a href="····" class="track">
        <?php echo $track->getName(); ?>
    </a>

    ····
    ```
##Comments Policy

- Write self-documented expressive code instead of heavily documented one
- Avoid writing comments to explain bad code. Refactor code to make it self-explanatory
- Keep existing comments up-to-date
- Write comments in **English**
- Avoid commented lines of code
- Avoid superflous comments

**TODO**: When to use comments

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**

###Annotations

- Mark todos and action items with ```TODO```
- Avoid using other anotations like ```FIXME```, ```OPTIMIZE```, etc
- Annotations should be written one line inmediately above the relevant code
- Append a contact (username or email) in parentheses as with the format ```TODO(contact)```
- Append action items after a colon as in ```TODO: action item```
- If multiple lines are required to describe the problem, subsequent lines should be indented

```html
<!-- TODO(joe.doe): remove optional tags -->
<ul>
    <li>Apples</li>
    <li>Oranges</li>
</ul>
```
