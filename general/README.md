##Introduction

This document defines general purpose formatting and style rules. It aims at improving collaboration, code quality, and enabling supporting infrastructure. It applies to raw, working files. Tools are free to obfuscate, minify, and compile as long as the general code quality is maintained.

##General Formatting Rules

Projects must apply the following formatting rules and IDEs should be tuned up to follow them.

> Specific style guides can override some of this rules.

- Use UTF-8 without BOM
- Use Unix line endings - LF, **not** CR (MacOS) or LF+CR (Windows)
- Use 4 white spaces identation

  ```javascript
  // Way to go:
  if (indent === 4) {
  ····var imHappy = true;
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  // Avoid this:
  ··var twoSpaces;
  ···>var orTabs;
  ```

- Remove trailing whitespaces

  ```html
  <!-- Bad, bad, bad -->
  <div class="error">Trailing white spaces ahead</div>····
  ```

- Use a **single** blank line to separate code blocks

  ```javascript
  // This is cool:
  var me = 'Hello';
  ····
  me = me + ' world!';
  me = me + ' Wazzup?!';
  ····
  var world = 'I am fine';
  ```

  ```javascript
  // This is not:
  var me = 'Hello';
  ····
  ····
  ····
  var world = 'Sorry, too many white lines, I can't hear you';
  ```

- Leave a single blank line at the end of the file

  ```javascript
  // Don't:
  endOfFile = true;
  ····
  ····
  ····
  ```

  ```javascript
  // Don't:
  endOfFile = true; // That's it, no blank lines
  ```

  ```javascript
  // Do:
  endOfFile = true;
  ····
  ```

##General Meta Rules

###Comments

Explain code as needed, where possible.

Use comments to explain code: What does it cover, what purpose does it serve, why is respective solution used or preferred?

> This item is optional as it is not deemed a realistic expectation to always demand fully documented code. Mileage may vary heavily for HTML and CSS code and depends on the project’s complexity.

**[[⬆]](#table-of-contents)**

###Action items

Mark todos and action items with ```TODO```.

Highlight todos by using the keyword ```TODO``` only, not other common formats like ```@@```.

Append a contact (username or mailing list) in parentheses as with the format ```TODO(contact)```.

Append action items after a colon as in ```TODO: action item```.

```html
<!-- TODO: remove optional tags -->
<ul>
    <li>Apples</li>
    <li>Oranges</li>
</ul>
```

###Versioning

How to number versions:

1.3.2: major=1 minor=3 patch=2

Typically you will see a real version, such as “1.2.0”
